## Exploring the Monty Hall Problem visually, hands on, and with a few numbers to enable understanding :door:

The Monty Hall Problem is a small puzzle involving unintuitive probability. It was orginially a game on a television show, hosted by Monty Hall. The premise is when given three doors, one with a car behind it and two with goats behind them, pick the door with the car behind it. However, after picking a door, Monty Hall would reveal one goat from a door the player had not chosen, and then the player has a choice to stay with the originally selected door or switch to the other door. At first glance, the choice may appear like a 50/50 chance of finding the car, but the truth is switching doors results in winning two thirds of the time!
